        <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
        <p class="muted">Effective Date: September 5, 2025</p>

        <p>Welcome to <strong>RecordBuddy</strong>. These Terms and Conditions (the “Terms”) govern your access to and use of the RecordBuddy mobile application (the “App”). By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>

        <h2>1. License to Use</h2>
        <p>Subject to these Terms, we grant you a limited, personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to use the App on devices you own or control for your own recording and note‑taking purposes.</p>

        <h2>2. Your Responsibilities</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Comply with laws.</strong> You are solely responsible for complying with all applicable laws when making recordings. Many regions require informing and obtaining consent from all participants before recording audio. <em>RecordBuddy does not support call recording.</em></li>
            <li><strong>Content ownership.</strong> You retain ownership of your recordings, transcripts, summaries, and annotations (“User Content”). You are responsible for the legality and the content of your recordings.</li>
            <li><strong>No misuse.</strong> Do not use the App to infringe rights, distribute unlawful content, attempt to reverse‑engineer the App, or interfere with its operation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. App Features & Permissions</h2>
        <p>The App may request the following system permissions to provide features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="kbd">Microphone</span> — to record audio.</li>
            <li><span class="kbd">Speech Recognition</span> — to transcribe audio (if enabled).</li>
            <li><span class="kbd">Photos</span> — to attach photo annotations (optional).</li>
            <li><span class="kbd">Files / iCloud Drive</span> — to save, import, or export recordings (optional).</li>
            <li><span class="kbd">Notifications</span> — status reminders, if you opt in (optional).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For details on how we process data, see our <a href="RecordBuddy_Privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

        <h2>4. In‑App Purchases</h2>
        <p>The App may offer optional in‑app purchases (e.g., Pro unlock for unlimited recording time). Purchases are processed by Apple and are subject to Apple’s terms. We do not receive your full payment details. Where applicable, manage or cancel purchases in your Apple account settings. Refunds are handled by Apple according to their policies.</p>

        <h2>5. Availability and Changes</h2>
        <p>We may update, change, or discontinue the App or any feature at any time without liability. We may also update these Terms by posting a revised version with a new Effective Date.</p>

        <h2>6. Interruptions & Safety</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The App is designed to handle interruptions (e.g., incoming calls) by pausing and resuming recording where possible; however, <strong>we do not guarantee</strong> that recordings will be preserved in every scenario.</li>
            <li>The App is <strong>not</strong> a substitute for emergency or professional services.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>We own all rights in and to the App, including software, designs, trademarks, and documentation, excluding your User Content. These Terms do not transfer any intellectual property rights to you.</p>

        <h2>8. Content & Storage</h2>
        <p>Your User Content is stored locally on your device by default. If you enable iCloud Drive or share/export files, storage and processing are provided by those services under their terms. You are responsible for backing up your content.</p>

        <h2>9. Disclaimers</h2>
        <p>The App is provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis, without warranties of any kind, express or implied. We do not warrant that the App will be uninterrupted, error‑free, or that defects will be corrected.</p>

        <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we and our affiliates will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of data, profits, or revenues, arising from your use of the App. Our total liability for any claim relating to the App will not exceed the amount you paid (if any) for the App in the 12 months preceding the claim.</p>

        <h2>11. Termination</h2>
        <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the App at any time if we reasonably believe you have violated these Terms. You may stop using the App at any time. Sections that by their nature should survive termination will survive (e.g., Disclaimers, Limitation of Liability).</p>

        <h2>12. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of British Columbia, Canada, without regard to its conflict of laws rules. You agree to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts located in British Columbia for any disputes arising from these Terms or the App.</p>

        <h2>13. Contact</h2>
